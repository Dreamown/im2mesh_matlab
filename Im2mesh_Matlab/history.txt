Fix the issue of failing to delete redundant vertex.
Fix the crash issue of function bounds2meshBuiltIn.
Fix bugs related to function bound2SurfaceLoop and function printMsh.
Improve workflow when using Gmsh as mesh generator.


Function poly2meshBuiltIn is deprecated. Please use function bounds2meshBuiltIn instead.

Function bounds2mesh - Revise the default value and valid range of parameter 'opt.bound_size'. New default value: 0. Uniform mesh seed will be added to boundary when opt.bound_size > 0.

Function bounds2mesh - add parameter opt.hinitial. It's used to avoid atrraction issue when specifying mesh size at multiple points.



new function:
bounds2meshBuiltIn
extractMsh
bounds2geo 	 ## need to add comments

## need to improve demo13
## need to revise demo14 (-> bounds2geo)


### Add checking when exprt mesh to other formats via Gmsh













---------------------
In Matlab, I have a 2d isolated triangular mesh defined two variables: vert, tria.

vert: Mesh nodes. Itâ€™s a Nn-by-2 matrix, where Nn is the number of nodes in the mesh. Each row of vert contains the x, y coordinates for that mesh node.
   
tria: Mesh elements. For triangular elements, it s a Ne-by-3 matrix, where Ne is the number of elements in  the mesh. Each row in tria contains the indices of the nodes for that mesh element.

I want to create a function to find boundary edges in the triangular mesh and then group boundary edges into separate loops. The output is a variable called 'loops'.
'loops' is a cell array of loops; loops{i} is a list of vertex IDs [v1, v2, ..., vK] that form a closed boundary chain. The last vertex equals the first vertex.
