function bounds = im2Bounds( im )
% im2Bounds: extract exact polygonal boundaries from grayscale segmented 
% image using getExactBounds.m
%
% input:
%   im - grayscale segmented image, type: uint8 matrix
%
% output:
%   bounds - cell array. bounds{i}{j} is one of the polygonal boundaries,  
%          corresponding to region with certain grayscale level in image.
%          Polygons in bounds{i} have the same grayscale level.
%          bounds{i}{j}(:,1) is x coordinate (column direction).
%          bounds{i}{j}(:,2) is y coordinate (row direction). You can use
%          plot( bounds{i}{j}(:,1), bounds{i}{j}(:,2) ) to view the
%          polygon. Use plotBounds( bounds ) to view all polygons, check
%          plotBounds.m.
%   bounds{i} is boundary polygons for one phase
